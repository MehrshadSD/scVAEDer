Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you'll find some of the codes we used in [our paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.13.536789v1) titled "The Power of Two: integrating deep diffusion models and variational autoencoders for single-cell transcriptomics analysis". I'll also keep updating this page with cool and useful papers related to Diffusion models. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in this area and think I can help you or have a question about the paper or the code.



Please find below some valuable resources that I came across: 
1) If you want to understand DDM fundamentals, this link offers an informative overview: [Link](https://aman.ai/primers/ai/diffusion-models/) 
2) Keras website provides useful resources on different aspects of DDMs: [Link](https://keras.io/examples/generative/random_walks_with_stable_diffusion/)
3) I highly recommend watching this informative tutorial from CVPR 2022 by Kreis, Gao, and Vahdat: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS6JQpEY9cs)
4) A fantastic repository containing a wide range of resources on Diffusion Models: [Link](https://github.com/heejkoo/Awesome-Diffusion-Models)

A few things to add to the above list. I really enjoyed the two courses below on diffusion models and I think its great to watch and review them. 
1*) Michael Elad's course is fantastic. It offers an in-depth exploration of the content and proofs. I highly recommend watching the Sparseland courses as well if you want to dive into the math behind diffusion: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mxCNMJ7dHM)
2*) I’ve also watched the Berkeley course on Generative AI, which is excellent. However, I personally prefer the Stanford Generative AI course by Stefano Ermon, particularly the sections on score matching and ALD: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNEujZmD2Tg&list=PLoROMvodv4rPOWA-omMM6STXaWW4FvJT8&index=2)
