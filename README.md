Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you'll find some of the codes we used in [our paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.13.536789v1) titled "The Power of Two: integrating deep diffusion models and variational autoencoders for single-cell transcriptomics analysis". I'll also keep updating this page with cool and useful papers related to Diffusion models. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in this area and think I can help you or have a question about the paper or the code.



Please find below some valuable resources that I came across: 
1) If you're looking to grasp the basics of DDMS, here provides an informative overview:: [Link](https://aman.ai/primers/ai/diffusion-models/) 
2) Keras website provides useful resources on different aspects of DDMs: [Link](https://keras.io/examples/generative/random_walks_with_stable_diffusion/)
3) I highly recommend watching this informative tutorial from CVPR 2022 by Kreis, Gao, and Vahdat: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS6JQpEY9cs)
4) A fantastic repository containing a wide range of resources on Diffusion Models: [Link](https://github.com/heejkoo/Awesome-Diffusion-Models)
